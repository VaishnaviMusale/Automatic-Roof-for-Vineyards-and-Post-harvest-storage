# Automatic-Roof-for-Vineyards-and-Post-harvest-storage
Hey everyone! I'm really excited to share my first-year B.Tech project with you: an automatic roof system for vineyards and post-harvest storage! This project is all about protecting our precious agricultural produce, especially grapes, from the harsh realities of bad weather – you know, those dreaded downpours and hailstorms that can devastate crops. ⛈️ The idea behind the system is simple: an automated roof that springs into action when it needs to. We're using sensors and actuators to make sure it deploys and retracts automatically, based on pre-set conditions or even real-time weather data. This way, our crops are always shielded and safe! This project is particularly close to my heart because it aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices. By minimizing post-harvest losses, we can ensure more food gets to your tables and less goes to waste. And guess what? It even got recognized for its potential! Our project was nominated for the Yukti Innovision Challenge by the Ministry of Education Innovation Cell in India. That was a huge motivator! Here's what you can find on this page:

A glimpse of the prototype: Take a look at the image  to get a feel for what we've built so far. You might even be able to find a video showcasing it in action (working on that!).
Deeper Dive: To understand the project's core, I've included links to some detailed documentation on Google Drive/Docs 
Problem Statement Canvas: This lays out all the agricultural challenges we're trying to tackle.
Empathy Map: Let's face it, farmers are the heroes here. This map captures their concerns and needs when it comes to weather protection.
Business Model Canvas: Ever wonder how this could work commercially? This breaks down the potential market, our value proposition, and how we might generate revenue in the future.
Presentation on Innovision & Business Opportunity: This explains the innovative aspects of the system and its potential for benefiting the world of agriculture. What's Next? This project is definitely a work in progress. Here's what I'm thinking about for the future:
Technical Specs Deep Dive: Maybe we can add some details about the tech behind the system – what sensors are we using, how do the actuators work, what controls everything? This would help others understand the project better and potentially join the development journey.
Prototype Showcase: Ideally, a short video demonstration would be amazing to show the prototype in action and its current functionalities.
The Road Ahead: There's so much more to explore! Integrating advanced weather forecasting, enabling remote monitoring and control, and even conducting field trials in real agricultural settings are all exciting possibilities. Join the Journey! This project is all about collaboration and innovation. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or expertise you'd like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out! Let's work together to make this automatic roof system a reality and protect the future of agriculture.
